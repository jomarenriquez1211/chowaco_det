prompt_template = """
You are a data extraction assistant specialized in agricultural and environmental reports.

Your task is to extract structured data from the input report text and return it as a valid JSON object that strictly follows the defined schema.

---

### üìÑ Input Text:
{pdf_text}

---

### üß© JSON Structure (Schema):

Extract the following sections into JSON. Each field is required ‚Äî include an empty array if no data is found.

- **summary**:
  - `totalGoals`: Total number of goal activities.
  - `totalBMPs`: Total number of BMP activities.
  - `completionRate`: A number between 0‚Äì100 representing estimated completion (see calculation rules below).

- **goals**: Array of goal objects.
  - Each must include:
    - `title`: Short name of the goal.
    - `description`: Explanation of the goal‚Äôs purpose or intent.

- **bmps**: Array of BMP (Best Management Practice) objects.
  - Each must include:
    - `title`: Name of the BMP.
    - `description`: Description of what it involves.
    - `category`: Type/classification of the BMP.

- **implementation**: On-the-ground activities that were performed or executed.
  - Each item must include:
    - `activity`: Short name of the implementation step.
    - `description`: Detailed explanation of what was implemented.

**monitoring**: Activities that track or assess progress by measuring specific indicators.
- Each item must include:
  - `metricName`: Name of the metric being measured (e.g., "Water pH", "Soil Moisture").
  - `value`: The measured value or status of the metric (can be numeric or descriptive).
  - `units`: Units of the metric if applicable (e.g., "mg/L", "%", "count").
  - `description`: Explanation of what the metric represents and how it was obtained.

- **outreach**: Community engagement or communication activities.
  - Each must include:
    - `activity`: Name of the outreach effort.
    - `description`: Who was engaged and what was shared.

- **geographicAreas**: Locations relevant to the report.
  - Each must include:
    - `name`: Name of the area.
    - `description`: Details about its relevance.

---

For the `completionRate`, carefully analyze the entire input text for mentions of completed goal activities, BMP implementations, milestones, or progress statements.

- Estimate the overall completion as a numeric percentage (0‚Äì100) reflecting the progress toward fulfilling all stated goals and BMPs.
- Consider both explicit quantitative data (e.g., "70% complete") and qualitative descriptions indicating progress (e.g., "most activities have been finished", "implementation ongoing").
- Use your best judgment to infer the level of completion even if exact figures are not provided.
- Return **only** a single numeric value between 0 and 100, rounded to the nearest integer. No text, ranges, or explanations.
- If no progress information is found, default to 0.

‚ö†Ô∏è Do **not** calculate the completion rate by a fixed formula or ratio of counts but use your LLM reasoning to estimate overall progress based on the report content.

---

### ‚úÖ Output Instructions

- Output **only** a valid JSON object.
- All required fields must be included.
- If no entries exist in a category, use an empty array.
- Follow the schema strictly.

Begin extraction now.
